# Android app for dro.pm

Tested on Android 4.1, 4.4, 5.1, and 7.0.

## Features

In the share menu you can select dro.pm to upload a file. Sharing text or links
does not work yet, I still have to find a moment to implement this.

## Contributing

The only file you really need to look at is main.java, which is a symlink to
`src/*/*/*/*/*.java`.

Contributions of any kind are welcome. Especially implementing the "share link"
and "share text" features are welcome, but if you just want to contribute an
icon, that's great too. If you have questions regarding the code or dro.pm's
API, please open an issue or see lucgommans.nl for other contact methods.

Your code retains your copyright, with (when you send it to me) an implicit
permission to use and modify it for this app. The code presently here can be
considered public domain, as there was not much creativity involved in merging
together examples to get to the current state of things :-)
