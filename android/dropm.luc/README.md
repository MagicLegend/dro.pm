# Android app for dro.pm

My device is a 4.4 so it should work best on that. If it bugs on yours, you
might want to check Android API differences.

It also seems to work on Android 5.1.

## Features

In the share menu you can select dro.pm to upload a file. Sharing text or links
does not work yet, I ran out out of time. (I wanted to make headway with a
report for school but it's 20:30 and I've done nothing about it yet.)

## Contributing

The only file you really need to look at is main.java, which is a symlink to
`src/*/*/*/*/*.java`.

Contributions of any kind are welcome. Namely implementing a "share link"
and/or "share text" feature are welcome, but if you just want to contribute an
icon, that's great too. If you have questions regarding the code or dro.pm's
API, ask me on Twitter (twitter.com/lucgommans) or open an issue.

Your code retains your copyright, with (when you send it to me) an implicit
permission to use and modify it for this app. Simple as that, no license
involved.
